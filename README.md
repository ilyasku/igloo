 This function intialises the monte carlo random walk class. Here most          of the simulation task will be done. Each fly is represented by 3 values          its position [mm], the environment temperature at this position [째C] and         its body temperature [째C]. The gradient is a one dimensional strip of         x mm length that has a linear temperature gradient with gradientExt as         the gradient extreme temperatures. The lower extreme temperature is          situated at 0 mm the hotter extreme temperature at the far end of the          gradient. The fly is further described by ots rearing temperature          (default: 25째C) and its preferred temperature (default: 21째C). The          original null model is a random walk.
