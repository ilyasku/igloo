This function intialises the monte carlo random walk class. Here most of the simulation task will be done. Each fly is represented by 3 values its position [mm], the environment temperature at this position [°C] and its body temperature [°C]. The gradient is a one dimensional strip of x mm length that has a linear temperature gradient with gradientExt as the gradient extreme temperatures. The lower extreme temperature is situated at 0 mm the hotter extreme temperature at the far end of the gradient. The fly is further described by its rearing temperature (default: 25°C).
