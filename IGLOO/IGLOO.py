        This function intialises the monte carlo random walk class. Here most 
        of the simulation task will be done. Each fly is represented by 3 values 
        its position [mm], the environment temperature at this position [°C] and
        its body temperature [°C]. The gradient is a one dimensional strip of
        x mm length that has a linear temperature gradient with gradientExt as
        the gradient extreme temperatures. The lower extreme temperature is 
        situated at 0 mm the hotter extreme temperature at the far end of the 
        gradient. The fly is further described by ots rearing temperature 
        (default: 25°C) and its preferred temperature (default: 21°C). The 
        original null model is a random walk.
